<H1>About Me</H1>
<img src="pic.jpg">
<p> My Name is Dinuk De Silva, I'm currently 22 years of age.</p>
<p> I'm an Computer Science undergratute in University of Colombo School of Computing, currently in my second year. </p>
<p> I live in Malabe and I did my Ordinary Levels and Advanced levels from Ananda College Colombo. </p>
<p> Technology and computing has always facinated me since I was a child, thus naturally my hobbies became extensions of that, such as video games, game development and ocassionally multimedia content creation. </p>
<p> I aspire to become a game developer, not as job but as a hobby.</p>
